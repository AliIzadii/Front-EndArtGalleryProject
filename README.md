# Front-EndArtGalleryProject
Front-End design of an art gallery site with html, css and js as university final project

This project have 12 pages about art gallery. It is contains 4 art's branches that include cinema, music, painting and pottery

Some points which I should say is that I did not have UI designer and I Designed it myself!
Moreover, I downloaded the images, so the size and quality of photos is not great (obviously need to fix). Another one is that whole text is sample, not real (ie I used lorem ipsum). Also for example in store's page all photo is repetitive (because it is just sample).
