# Front-EndArtGalleryProject
Front-End design of an art gallery site with html, css and js
This project contains 11 pages about art gallery. Some points which I should say is that I did not have UI designer and I Designed it myself!
Moreover, I downloaded the images, so the size and quality of photos is not great. Another one is that whole text is sample, not real (ie I used lorem ipsum). Also for example in painting store's page all photo is repetitive (because it is just sample).
